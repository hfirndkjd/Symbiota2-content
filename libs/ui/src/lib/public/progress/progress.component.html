      <p>
        The “Requirements document” was created to help show what has been done
        and is needed to provide Symbiota2 with the same abilities as Symbiota
        at the time the Symbiota2 project started but with improved performance
        and usability plus greater ease of maintenance. The document also
        provides a rough means of measuring progress towards completion of
        release 1. For now, only the document is available. We shall develop the
        progress summaries at the end of August.

        Completing essential plugins, some incorporating small changes that
        address users’ suggestions. Created a requirements document [Link this
        to pdf of Symbiota2-requirements and associated spreadsheet to summarize
        progress. Redesigned
        <a href="https://symbiota2.org" target="_blank" class="main-link"

        to display progress and enable feedback.

      <h2 class="heading-tertiary-2">Year 3</h2>
      <p>
        Converted to Typescript, Angular, TypeORM, rewriting and documenting
        core backend components and started creating essential plugins
        (Collections, Occurrences, Taxonomy, Images).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Created 3 websites for following progress, each of which offers a
        different view. Initiated “Open discussion sessions” for summarizing
        recent developments and and stimulating discussion. These will help
        ensure Symbiota2 meets user needs. We cannot promise to incorporate all
        suggestions before the end of the project, but the feedback will help
        prioritize our activities while ensuring that other desired features can
        be added later relatively simply. Information about upcoming sessions is
        posted to three listservs. People can also ask to be added to the
        project’s mailing list via the contact page.

        Refactoring and preparation for acceptance of plugin architecture. These
        essential tasks were completed within a PHP framework. At the end of
        that time, review of the project’s objectives combined with a review of
        new programming languages led to the decision to rewrite the code using
