      Symbiota2’s development will require refactoring, modifying, and extending
      the code in three broad areas: User Interface, Informatics, and
      Extensibility. To achieve its goals, the refactoring of Symbiota will
      emphasize modularity and strictly conform to best practices and current
      design standards

    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Architecture</h2>
    <div class="arch-container">
      <p class="arch-text">
        Symbiota has a three-tier architecture, as shown in Figure 4, with each
        tier representing the physical separation of processing and data
        management. The Data tier, shown in the right of the figure, is a MySQL
        DBMS. A search engine, Apache SOLR, can also be installed and configured
        to index the database. Images, typically of specimens, are stored
        external to the DBMS. The Server tier hosts the Symbiota code base. The
        Client tier is a web browser. A Client initiates an HTTP call that
        executes Server-side code. Some executions get data from the DBMS or
        SOLR. GUI formatting occurs in both the execution of PHP files on the
        Server and through JavaScript in the Client.
      </p>

    </div>
    <img src="../../../assets/img/Figure5.jpg" alt="" class="img-style1" />
    <p>
      In Symbiota2, the architecture will change to that depicted in Figure 5.
      The Data tier remains largely the same, with one important change;
      Symbiota2 will interact with the DBMS and SOLR through a Database
      Abstraction Layer. The layer will map between objects in memory and
      storage in a supported DBMS (Goal 3). The Server tier will change in three
      ways: First, we will utilize the Database Abstraction Layer for Data tier
      calls. Second, the functionality of Symbiota will be repacked into the
      Symbiota2 API (Goal 1). Third, the data modeling and operations in
      Symbiota2 will be refactored into a plugin based framework (Goal 2). This
      refactoring will enable extensibility, allowing processing of new kinds of
      data to be quickly added (Goal 6). It will also support a CMS, which could
      be optionally installed to provide improved customization and maintenance
      of the portal (Goal 5). Clients will interact with Symbiota2 through a web
      browser or a RESTful web services API. The current look and feel of
      Symbiota will be accessed through Symbiota2’s native interface included
      with the software. Symbiota2 will be packaged for installation using
      Docker
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '71')">[71]</a>,
      making it easier for portal managers to install and update on all major
      operating systems.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We will create much of Symbiota2 through refactoring
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '26')">[26]</a>
      of the Symbiota code. Symbiota modules will be refactored into separate
      plugins (formatting, design, and functionality) controlled within an
      AngularJS framework parsed within the client’s browser. All data modeling,
      processing, and database interactions will occur within the server-side
      scripts. The client-side framework will interact with the server-side
      framework through the Symbiota2 API via JSON. Server-side scripts in
      Symbiota have been developed in PHP. All server-side legacy functionality
      refactored from Symbiota into Symbiota2 will also be written in PHP (See
      change implemented in 2020). However, Symbiota2 will also encourage
      development in other languages.
    </p>
    <br /><span class="text-note">
      Note added in 2021: We have switched to using Typescript and Angular for
      the code, plus TypeORM for web services. This reduces the number of
      languages and platforms involved while providing greater flexibility,
      scalability, and speed. Moreover, it will make it easier for biologists,
      many of whom now learn languages such as r and Python, to develop plugins
      for Symbiota2, thereby increasing the number of potential developers (Goal
      4). Consequently, some of the following paragraphs are no longer relevant. </span
    ><br />
    <p>
      Note that we are working with a large, pre-existing code base written in
      PHP, which continues to be a popular language for server-side coding. A
      July 2017 survey estimated that PHP is used to power 82.7% of all websites
      whose server-side language is known
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '69')">[69]</a>.
      In language popularity surveys, such as the TIOBE index
      <a class="main-link">[68]</a> and Redmonk’s
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '55')">[55]</a>,
      PHP ranks seventh and fourth, respectively of the many thousands of
      programming languages. One factor in PHP’s continuing popularity for web
      development is that PHP is the language for most CMSs including the three
      most popular: WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '17')">[17]</a>.
      However, other languages are becoming popular for development. Symbiota2
      will allow for future development of server-side data modeling and
      processing in various languages by implementing a clean separation between
      client-side GUI processes and server-side data processes, offering a
      modular, plugin-based architectural framework, using Oauth2 for security
      credentials (which Symbiota currently uses), and by passing information
      internally via JSON.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Symbiota2 and its server-side dependencies will be packaged in a Docker
      image and be available through DockerHub
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '22')">[22]</a>
      so that it can be installed on various platforms. The Docker image will be
      installed within a Docker container that can be run offline. In offline
      mode, Symbiota2 will employ a SQLite database to store data. When an
      Internet connection is available, offline installations of Symbiota2 will
      be able to connect with an online Symbiota2 portal and sync data that has
      been either added or edited locally while offline (Goal 6).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Symbiota2 will use the same run-time environment as Symbiota; that is, it
      will use PHP and a DBMS, and optionally a CMS like WordPress on the server
      side, and JavaScript on the client side. Everything except the CMS is
      bundled together in web server solutions stacks like XAMPP
      <a class="main-link">[74]</a>. Such stacks also exist for smart devices,
      for instance the KSWeb app for Android
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '37')">[37]</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">User Interface Plans</h2>
    <p>
      Users want to be able to customize the look-and-feel and navigation of
      Symbiota, and easily add and edit content (Goal 5). Symbiota is
      challenging to customize, whether adding a Facebook “like” button or
      adding new content outside of the Symbiota core pages. Additionally, the
      menu system and navigation is ad hoc, difficult to change, and can be
      confusing to use, making it hard for users to locate many of the tools
      within the software. Missing from Symbiota are common navigational aids
      like site search, breadcrumbs, and customizable menus. Though Symbiota
      does allow some CSS styling to be customized, Symbiota does not use
      external CSS for all style decisions, rather it embeds some style choices
      in the code (e.g., a font must be 10pt). Symbiota also supports limited
      customization of the layout—only the header, footer, and sidebars can be
      changed.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Symbiota2 will incorporate easier GUI customization and responsiveness in
      several ways. First, we will use CSS for formatting. Second, we will
      refactor the Symbiota GUI code into an AngularJS framework, leaving all
      display decisions occurring in the client-side code while communicating
      with the server-side data modeling and operations code through JSON. This
      will provide a much more adaptable GUI that can responsively adjust to
      mobile devices. Third, we will create a Symbiota2 WordPress plugin to
      allow for integration with the WordPress CMS. This will leverage the
      functionality offered by WordPress, which is by far the most popular CMS
      (used by 36% of CMS backed websites, followed by Drupal with 8%
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '17')">[17]</a>),
      and will offer significant savings in coding effort because many of the
      features Symbiota users desire, such as a responsive, customizable layout,
      are already available in WordPress. The plugin will interact with the
      WordPress Plugin API
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '76')">[76]</a>
      and bridge communication between it and the core Symbiota2 API. This will
      allow for the AngularJS GUI plugins of Symbiota2 to be routed into the
      WordPress framework (Goal 2). If there is a community need for another
      CMS, say Drupal, we will convert the WordPress plugins to that CMS.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      These changes will improve the user interface and design of Symbiota2, but
      we also plan to remain compatible with Symbiota’s current user interface
      by providing a Symbiota2 native interface. The native interface will have
      the look-and-feel of Symbiota, including its layout, styling, and
      navigation, but with the added benefit of responsive layout.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Informatics Plans</h2>
    <p>
      The core of Symbiota2 will be an API to coordinate communication between
      the client-side GUI and server-side data processing. These services will
      also be publicly accessible so that other applications can incorporate
      them into their visualizations or workflows (Goal 1). All Symbiota2 API
      endpoints will return JSON responses and the API will be documented using
      the OpenAPI specification
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '60')">[60]</a>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Symbiota uses MySQL to manage data. We will integrate Doctrine
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '70')">[70]</a>,
      a database abstraction layer, into Symbiota2 so that a different DBMS
      could be used (Goal 3). Doctrine has high-level, DBMS-independent
      operations to read, update, and query objects. A mapping maps the logical
      operations on objects into low-level data storage operations for a
      specific DBMS
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '4')">[4]</a>.
      This project will refactor Symbiota to replace the MySQL calls with
      Doctrine calls and then use Doctrine’s object-relational mapping (ORM) for
      MySQL and create mappings for Postgres, SQLite, and Google’s Cloud
      Spanner. The SQLite mapping is needed for the offline mode (Goal 6)
      because only SQLite can be run on some devices (such as smart phones).
      Cloud Spanner is a scalable relational DBMS that may be needed in the
      future as use of Symbiota2 grows to accommodate 500 million specimens
      (Goal 4). The Postgres mapping is being created in response to user
      requests as an alternative to MySQL.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We shall also add the ability to synchronize data so that clients without
      continuous Internet access can use the offline mode to add occurrence
      records or update a taxon. The database abstraction layer will log each
      change to an object as a record consisting of the old and the new version
      of an object represented in JSON, akin to how recovery logs are maintained
      in relational DBMSs
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '43')">[43]</a>.
      To merge changes, the log will be processed to find matching old versions
      and update to new versions with manual approval. Non-matching old
      versions, which we anticipate will be rare, will be placed in a workflow
      for manual merging. Note that GUIDs or other auto-incremented IDs
      generated for new versions while in offline mode may have to be updated as
      part of the merging, so the merging process will need to keep a dictionary
      of IDs in the log mapped to updated IDs in the data store. We will use a
      software lock to ensure that only one merge is active at a time.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Extensibility Plans</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most frequent user requests is to be able to add new kinds of
      data to a portal, for instance descriptive information or bibliographic
      information (Goal 6). To meet this need, we will develop a modular
      framework for extending Symbiota2. This framework is key to enabling an
      active developer community to collaborate in code enhancements while
      maintaining existing functions. The framework will support the development
      of new plugins, as well as provide updates to existing functions in the
      form of class extensions (Goal 2). A plugin in the framework will have
      three key components: 1) a model class defining the structure of an
      object, 2) methods to clean and manage the object, and 3) templates to
      visualize and format the object, e.g., as JSON, for use in web services or
      rendered as HTML. Existing code will be refactored to utilize the
      framework. This will also allow portal managers to customize each
      Symbiota2 instance from a selection of plugins.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We will use a combination of class auto-loading, code namespaces, and a
      routing class register to organize run-time plugin management. This class
      routing registration will allow for development of RESTful web services
      (Goal 1). This type of modular design will produce a cleaner code base for
      developer collaborations, faster product development, and assist in
      simplifying code maintenance, all features that will help sustain a strong
      product lifespan and data dissemination while supporting cross-domain data
      fusion applications.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The plugin framework will also support new data analytics tools. Symbiota
      excels at providing data on the distribution of biodiversity and images of
      specimens, but currently does not support other facets of biodiversity
      such as phylogenetic diversity or the timing of emergence
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '53')">[53]</a>.
      As part of the development of Symbiota2, we will both fill this key gap
      and demonstrate the power of the new plugin framework with two new
      plugins. Critically, these plugins will be developed through a
      collaboration between our biologist and informatician co-PIs (Pearse and
      Brandt), who will explore the outputs of the tools during development and
      use them to develop a series of online research guides that showcase the
      use of the tools to answer research questions about the distribution of
      biodiversity throughout North America. The two plugins will provide
      concrete examples for third-party developers and showcase Symbiota2’s
      extensible framework.

    <h3 class="heading-tertiary-2">Phylogeny plugin</h3>
    <p>
      All species are related in their phylogeny, which represents the shared
      ancestry among species. Phylogeny is useful as a way to organize and
      classify species (a species’ taxonomy is produced from its position in a
      phylogeny), and also to understand the function of species and how
      productive or stable an ecosystem will be
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '14')">[14]</a
      ><a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '25')">[25]</a>.
      We will develop a plugin, by adapting and reusing R code we wrote
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '48')">[48]</a>,
      that will allow users to download a phylogeny of the species whose records
      they are exploring, and to calculate and visualize the phylogenetic
      diversity of a given region (e.g., Figure 6).
    </p>
    <img
      src="../../../assets/img/Figure6.jpg"
      alt="Figure 6"
      class="img-style1"
    />
    <h3 class="heading-tertiary-2">Phenology plugin</h3>
    <p>
      Climate and land-use change is not just altering the distribution of
      species, but also the timing of their life-history events
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '42')">[42]</a
      ><a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '47')">[47]</a>,
      and there is an emerging eco-informatics need to serve users with
      phenological data to support their research. Building on a novel
      statistical framework that enables the estimation of the timing of events
      (e.g., plant flowering, insect emergence, and bird migrations) from
      observation data
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '49')">[49]</a>,
      we will develop a plugin that will inform the user, based on records
      within Symbiota2, when the species within a given area are likely to be
      active. This will not just support research into changes in phenology
      through time and space, but also help the general public identify species
      by excluding species not currently active or in bloom at the time of their
      visit to a region.
    </p>

  <div class="row">
    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">
      Standards, Testing, Evaluation, and Transitioning to Symbiota2
    </h2>
    <p>
      Symbiota2 will follow the best practices and current standards in
      community-driven, open-source software engineering, including
      version-controlled source code and test data using GitHub; providing
      thorough documentation that is continuously tested; extensive unit and
      integration testing through a maintained testing framework using PHPUnit
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '52')">[52]</a>
      and Jasmine
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '35')">[35]</a>;
      and strict adherence to coding style standards with code linting. The
      Symbiota2 API will be extensively documented using the OpenAPI
      specification. Symbiota2 will strictly adhere to the PHP PSR
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '50')">[50]</a>
      and the AngularJS Style Guide
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '6')">[6]</a>
      coding standards. These community standards detail how code should be
      written and will ensure that the coding style will be consistent
      throughout the code base, helping to make it more understandable for a
      large development team and accessible to new contributors with minimal
      effort.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We will create an automated testing suite for the Symbiota2 API using
      PHPUnit. This will be used to test all additions and modifications to the
      API. To ensure stability, we will enact a stability cycle policy that we
      will post on the Symbiota2 GitHub wiki. The policy will specify that all
      modifications to the API will be thoroughly tested before being determined
      as stable and going into production. Once stable developments have been
      released, any functionality that will be lost due to backwards
      incompatible modifications to the API will be flagged as deprecated for a
      three-month period before the change goes into production to give
      Symbiota2 developers and other API users confidence in developing using
      the API.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The plugin framework (Goal 2) will enable us to adopt a “piecemeal”
      approach to transitioning the code base from Symbiota to Symbiota2 whereby
      we will first create the plugin framework and then refactor Symbiota code
      into modules to plugin to the framework. Un-refactored, legacy Symbiota
      code will be retained for backwards-compatibility as new modules come
      online. Hence a portal will be able to transition smoothly from Symbiota
      to Symbiota2 at any point in the development of Symbiota2 with no loss of
      functionality and continued use of the legacy interface, and with new
      (simpler) installation and update methods using Docker.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We will periodically re-evaluate Symbiota2 using PHPMetrics. This will
      provide an independent measure of our coding efforts and help to pinpoint
      areas in the code where the refactoring needs to be further improved. We
      expect to see a steady improvement in the software metrics. A second
      dimension of evaluation is comparing the performance of Symbiota2 to
      Symbiota for a suite of benchmark activities (e.g., insert 1000 occurrence
      records). While we do not anticipate that our transformation of Symbiota
      into Symbiota2 will degrade performance, the comparison will help to
      isolate and mitigate cases of poor performance. For instance, if when
      adding a database abstraction layer using Doctrine, we observe degraded
      performance, we can do further testing to determine why and explore
      implementation alternatives.
