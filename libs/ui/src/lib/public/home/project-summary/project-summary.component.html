      Project summary
    </h1>
    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Biological collections in the United States have amassed over 500 million
      specimens, yet there are still no tools and methods to efficiently
      digitize specimen data. This project addresses this need by transforming
      Symbiota, one of the most widely used software platforms for mobilizing
      specimens in US research collections. Symbiota is an online biodiversity
      data management software platform that integrates data and images from
      networks of data providers. It has helped mobilize over 37 million
      specimen records from 766 natural history collections and is one of the
      most successful platforms for creating large collaborative data
      communities for sharing and displaying biodiversity data. Symbiota is used
      by 74% of the projects funded by the NSF Advancing Digitization of
      Biological Collections program and is thus a key platform to help digitize
      the estimated 430 million specimens in US collections that have yet to be
      digitized. Symbiota’s success is largely due to its low learning curve and
      powerful set of tools for documenting species occurrences and integrating
      them with images and detailed taxonomic descriptions. But its widespread
      use has yielded significant feedback on how it could be made more
      effective. To accomplish this and aid its future development, Symbiota
      needs a fundamental restructuring. This project will transform Symbiota
      into a new version, Symbiota2, to catalyze contributions, expand research
      use, enrich education-outreach activities, and increase sustainability.

    <p>
      The transformation of Symbiota into Symbiota2 will completely refactor its
      code structure to emphasize modularity and improve usability and
      accessibility. This transformation will achieve the following goals,
      derived through direct management of Symbiota data portals and concerted
      interactions with the Symbiota user community: 1) Provide RESTful web
      services so that data can be easily incorporated into a scientific
      workflow, 2) Build a plugin architecture to ease the development of new
      features, 3) Create a database abstraction layer to include a wide variety
      of backend database management systems, 4) Increase data utility by
      supporting analytical and visualization tools, 5) Separate the Graphical
      User Interface (GUI) from other processing so that new GUIs can be used,
      and 6) Enhance the data collection by making it easier to add new kinds of
      data and work offline. With these goals met, Symbiota2 will be a powerful
      biodiversity data management system fulfilling the needs of developers,
      data providers, researchers, and education professionals, as well as being
      interoperable with other biodiversity initiatives.

    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Broader Impacts</h2>
    <p>
      Symbiota2 will enhance our ability to address a broad spectrum of
      biodiversity-related research questions by facilitating data
      visualization, linking multiple data sources (e.g., publications),
      creating better tools for data quality assessment, and monitoring data
      usage. By improving usability and interoperability with collaborating
      software platforms, Symbiota2 will boost the productivity of developers
      and data providers, and encourage more institutions to participate in
      biodiversity information networks. Research guides will help researchers
      use the research tools developed during the project. Annually, over 1,000
      people contribute data to Symbiota portals. Symbiota2 workflows, in
      combination with enhanced training material, will better support these
      users and grow this user base further. Tutorials for Symbiota2 will help
      these individuals understand biodiversity concepts and engage in
      inquiry-based activities that will allow them to understand concepts and
      answer key questions. A dedicated support website will facilitate
      engagement of citizen scientists in both digitization and research. Two
      complementary education activities will reach K-12 through undergraduate
      students and citizen scientists. Educators will benefit from the
      development of education modules and through development of a high school
      level biodiversity portal covering ecology and biodiversity. Our training
      programs will encourage students in biodiversity to include programming
      ability in their repertoire. We have the organizational support through
      the Symbiota Working Group to implement this strong program of broader
      impacts.
