<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>
  This site provides information about the Symbiota2 NSF-ABI project. Symbiota2
  will make it easier to modify and enhance Symbiota. What is Symbiota? It is
  open source software that has mobilized over 50 million specimen records from
  over 800 natural history collections, integrated their data with other
  resources, and shared the resulting information in ways that appeal to
  multiple user groups. Symbiota’s success stems from its low learning curve,
  powerful tools, and ability to integrate specimen records other resources such
  as images and detailed taxonomic descriptions and display them in ways that
  appeal to multiple user groups. Its success has resulted in many requests for
  additional abilities, but this is difficult because of the structure of its
  code. The Symbiota2 project involves restructuring of Symbiota’s code,
  transforming it in ways that will catalyze contributions, expand research use,
  enrich education and outreach activities, and increase sustainability.
