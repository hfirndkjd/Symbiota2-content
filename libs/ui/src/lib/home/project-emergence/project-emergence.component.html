      Emergence of Symbiota and Current Needs
    </h1>
    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Symbiota Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Biodiversity informatics is a rapidly developing field that uses a large
      amount of data on the current and historical distribution of species to
      address important research questions such as the impact of climate change
      on biological diversity. Symbiota
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '28')">[28]</a>
      has been a key player in providing the necessary data infrastructure. It
      is built on the premise that a collaborative partnership of biodiversity
      informaticians, collection managers, and biodiversity research communities
      will be most effective in creating high quality biodiversity research
      resources with publicly useful portals
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '27')">[27]</a>.
      Symbiota has two fundamental and overlapping functions: (1) it serves as a
      data management system for entering, annotating, and cleaning biodiversity
      occurrence data and associated specimen data (e.g., genetic sequences,
      images, publications) (Figure 1, left panel); (2) it acts as a primary
      aggregator/publisher (Figure 1, center panel) for data providers,
      primarily museums and herbaria, regardless of the software they use to
      enter and annotate data. Finally, it provides data to global aggregators
      and the public through Darwin Core (DwC) archives.

      Symbiota Emerges as a Key Platform for Management of Biological Specimen
      Data
    </h2>
    <p>
      Symbiota emerged in the late 1990s primarily as an online collections
      management system to meet the needs of herbaria. With the onset of NSF’s
      Advancing Digitization of Biodiversity Collections (ADBC) program in 2011,
      the use of Symbiota as an online biodiversity data management software
      platform expanded significantly. It is now used by 766 collections (412
      live, 354 snapshot; see description below) to share data via 40 portals
      structured by taxa, regions, or institutional holdings. Symbiota is a core
      component for 13 Thematic Collection Networks, and 8 Partners to Existing
      Networks (PEN) projects funded by NSF’s ADBC program
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '65')">[65]</a>
      comprising 74 percent of NSF-ADBC projects. This has led to an exponential
      increase in Symbiota data since 2011: Symbiota portals have grown to offer
      over 37 million occurrence records (11 million live collections, 26
      million snapshot collections), encompassing diverse taxonomic groups such
      as vascular plants, lichens, bryophytes, algae, fungi, invertebrates, and
      vertebrates. Symbiota data, or the software itself, has been cited in
      1,993 publications (Google Scholar, 24, August, 2017). Fourteen of the
      largest Symbiota portals collectively averaged 1,601 sessions per day
      (Google analytics for Oct 1, 2015 to Sept 30, 2016).

    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Portal Organization and Symbiota Workflow</h2>
    <p>
      A Symbiota portal is structured around data collections, usually grouped
      by data provider, with each collection maintaining its own dataset. Data
      may be generated directly in the Symbiota portal (Figure 1, left panel) or
      integrated from other sources (Figure 1, middle panel). Symbiota portals
      then utilize a suite of tools to annotate data (e.g., georeferencing,
      computer-aided identification), package datasets (e.g., checklists), and
      visualize data for research, conservation, and education (e.g., a spatial
      module). We are constantly adding functionality to Symbiota in response to
      user requests via the Symbiota GitHub repository
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '62')">[62]</a>.
      Data and images are publicly available via Darwin Core (DwC) archives
      <a class="main-link">[21]</a
      ><a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '57')">[57]</a>
      with the ability to link to Global Biodiversity Information Facility
      (GBIF)
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '72')">[72]</a>
      and Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio)
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '21')">[2]</a>.
      GBIF is the recognized global aggregator for all biodiversity information
      (607 million records served) and iDigBio is the National Resource for the
      ADBC program (106 million records served) (Figure 1, right panel). We
      expect that most Symbiota data will be accessed at aggregator portals,
      however we know that many users, especially data providers, use data
      directly from Symbiota portals.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The power of Symbiota comes from its ability to seamlessly integrate
      occurrence data with images and taxonomic information pages, and provide
      multifunctional checklist tools used by government agencies
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '24')">[24]</a>,
      educators
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '8')">[8]</a
      ><a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '75')">[75]</a>,
      and researchers
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '58')">[58]</a>.
      Symbiota also provides tools that allow researchers to compile and screen
      datasets for further analysis
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '27')">[27]</a
      ><a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '58')">[58]</a>,
      educators to integrate the use of biodiversity data in classroom
      activities, and land managers to compile data on species for management
      planning. Symbiota connects to global resources such as GenBank
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '29')">[29]</a>
      and Encyclopedia of Life
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '73')">[73]</a>,
      and can be used by collections to supply data to aggregators, such as
      iDigBio and GBIF.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Most of the 40+ Symbiota portals focus on a taxonomic group of interest
      (e.g., plants, arthropods) and a geographic area, typically within North
      America. A Symbiota portal is very decentralized: each data provider has
      control over their own data, although everyone operates within shared data
      standards and practices. There are two primary categories of “collections”
      in a Symbiota portal: (1) “live collections” that enter, clean (i.e.,
      edit), and annotate data directly in the portal via a browser, and (2)
      “snapshot collections” that enter, edit, and annotate data with various
      other software programs (Figure 1) but then provide their data to one or
      more Symbiota portals. All collections benefit from the shared data in
      terms of cleaning/annotating data, identifying gaps in their digitization
      effort, batch georeferencing, and quickly assessing data available for
      research. By offering support for a variety of data sources, Symbiota
      portals maximize the ability for everyone to clean and annotate their data
      by allowing collection managers to choose the approach that best fits the
      needs and abilities of their institution while maintaining (‘behind the
      scenes’) data standards that allow for open data sharing.

      There are four general categories of people connected to Symbiota portals.

    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Organizing the Symbiota Community</h2>
    <p>
      In 2016 the Symbiota Working Group
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '63')">[63]</a>
      was created to develop a more formal long-term structure that would better
      address community needs and create sustainability pathways for Symbiota.
      As part of that effort, conversations with developers of other software
      platforms that overlap in function with Symbiota have been ongoing,
      focusing on the possibility for collaboration and for identifying
      “collective impact” activities that promote interoperability among
      competing software platforms. The consensus is that the programs differ
      enough in their base code that integrating platforms is not an option,
      whereas sharing modules and functionality through Application Programming
      Interfaces (APIs) is a fruitful avenue. For example, the Symbiota
      development team is collaborating with TaxonWorks
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '64')">[64]</a>
      to add support for their taxonomic services and in turn, adapting the
      Symbiota spatial module to be compatible within TaxonWorks. As Symbiota
      development is enhanced through greater modularity, future collaborations
      are expected.

      Need for Restructuring and Enhancing Symbiota
    </h2>
    <p>
      Symbiota supports a rapidly expanding user community but its code
      complexity and design are impeding further development. Symbiota is a
      large, complex software system. It is written in PHP and Javascript and,
      as of August 2017, consisted of 160,603 lines of code spanning 168 classes
      (typically one class per file) and 3,386 methods (functions) within the
      core code base, excluding external libraries. The classes are highly
      inter-related as depicted in Figure 2.
    </p>
    <img
      src="../../../assets/img/Figure2&amp;3.jpg"
      alt="Need for Restructuring and Enhancing Symbiota figure 2 &amp; 3"
      class="img-style1"
    />
    <p>
      Software metrics
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '31')">[31]</a>
      can be used to estimate the complexity of software and the difficulty of
      extending, maintaining, and fixing bugs
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '36')">[36]</a>.
      We computed the software metrics for Symbiota using PHPMetrics
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '51')">[51]</a>.
      Symbiota scores poorly on several metrics, for example, Figure 3 depicts
      its cyclometric complexity (number of paths through the code). Large red
      circles are classes with high complexity, which impairs maintainability
      and code correctness. Symbiota also scores poorly in PHPMetrics’ summary
      evaluation along five categories relative to other PHP projects:
      maintainability (19 out of 100), accessibility for new developers (0 out
      of 100), simplicity of algorithms (0 out of 100), volume (0 out of 100),
      and reducing the probability of bugs (0 out of 100). Symbiota’s low scores
      imply that it is costly to develop, extend, and maintain in terms of
      programming time and effort
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '10')">[10]</a>.
      One reason Symbiota has low scores is that its functionality is highly
      integrated. A single class will combine code for the user interface,
      database queries and updates, and other functionality. So, for example, to
      change the user interface to create a responsive layout adapted to a
      mobile platform may require reprogramming hundreds of files.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Symbiota is typical of biodiversity and bioinformatics data management
      applications in that it has a long development cycle, usually lasting
      years. The development investment makes the projects valuable, but over
      time new needs arise, and users want new features
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '40')">[40]</a>.
      The Symbiota user community has posted over ninety desired changes to date
      on the Symbiota Issues list on GitHub, ranging from narrow (e.g., “add a
      field for host organism to the database”) to expansive (e.g., “make it so
      that data usage statistics for every record are available”)
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '62')">[62]</a>.
      Integrating these changes into Symbiota would be much easier with a better
      software structure. In summary, Symbiota has succeeded in creating many
      online biodiversity collection communities and growing a dedicated
      community of users. But Symbiota needs to be restructured to expand the
      developer pool, incorporate new functionalities, and enable even more
      collections to share data.
