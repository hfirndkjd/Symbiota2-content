      Project Goals and the Creation of Symbiota2
    </h1>
    <p class="text-center font-size-mid1">
      We will transform Symbiota into an improved software platform: Symbiota2.
      The features requested by the Symbiota community via the forum and are
      distilled into the following six goals for this development program.
    </p>

    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">
      Goal 1. Provide RESTful (representational state transfer) web services
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is growing demand to use Symbiota in a scientific workflow with
      other applications, for example as a data provider to the Interior
      Collections Management System that catalogues and manages all the
      collections owned by the U.S. Department of the Interior, or as a step in
      morphological, geographic, and ecological analyses. Symbiota2 will have an
      expanded API framework and offer a variety of RESTful web services that
      will enable external applications to efficiently pull data into workflows,
      export data using specific filters and in specific formats, and import
      data into the Symbiota2 portal.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Goal 2. Plugin design and deployment</h2>
    <p>
      The project team will refactor Symbiota into plugin modules that have
      cohesive functionality, e.,g., a plugin to upload scientific names from a
      file. Refactoring Symbiota’s functionality into plugins will create an
      extensible framework for development. Users will be able to customize
      Symbiota2 by selecting only desired plugins and creating new plugins as
      needed. Refactoring will also allow Symbiota to be transformed into
      Symbiota2 in stages rather than requiring all of the pieces to be in place
      before Symbiota2 is released.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">
      Goal 3. Accommodate other Database Management Systems
    </h2>
    <p>
      As biodiversity data collections grow in size, new kinds of data storage
      and data analyses need to be supported. Symbiota2 will offer a variety of
      database management system (DBMS) options to store biodiversity data.
      Symbiota’s data is currently stored in a relational database comprising
      143 tables managed by a MySQL DBMS. Database operations are spread
      throughout the code and are specific to MySQL. The project team will
      create a database abstraction layer and object relational mappings for
      MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, and Google’s Cloud Spanner
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '16')">[16]</a>.
      This will result in a database abstraction that models the data as a
      collection of objects and maps each object to a database table. The
      abstraction layer ensures that all data manipulation and querying is
      performed by the mapping, encapsulates the DBMS operations in a single
      place and, importantly, enables other DBMSs to be used by changing the
      mapping.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Goal 4. Increase Data Utility</h2>
    <p>
      Symbiota2 will help scientific researchers analyze and make use of
      biodiversity data by providing new ways to view the data and creating a
      framework for running analysis tools. A key part of Symbiota2 will be the
      ability to develop and integrate tools for analyzing data. Symbiota2 will
      have an external API (Goal 1) so that tools can pull data, and will also
      have a plugin architecture (Goal 2) so that tools can be closely
      integrated. To further increase data utility, we plan to export a
      Symbiota2 knowledge graph
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '30')">[30]</a>.
      A knowledge graph is a semantically-rich collection of linked data.
      Ontologies help define and describe the data and create opportunities for
      semantically linking the data to other graphs. Symbiota2 will leverage
      taxon ontologies

    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Goal 5. Separate form from function</h2>
    <p>
      Symbiota’s Graphical User Interface (GUI) is programmed into many PHP
      files that also manipulate the data and perform other functions. Many, but
      not all, style decisions in the GUI are controlled by a collection of
      Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) rules. By cleanly separating the GUI from the
      core functionality the code can be reduced in size and complexity, thereby
      becoming more maintainable and extensible. Model, view, controller (MVC)
      frameworks (e.g., Ruby on Rails
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '54')">[54]</a>)
      are often used to create such a separation, but Symbiota was developed
      before their value was recognized
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '20')">[20]</a>.
      Adding an MVC framework to Symbiota will also promote Content Management
      System (CMS) integration. Customized content has often been challenging to
      add for Symbiota portal managers with little experience in web
      development. Many managers have taken the approach of creating a separate
      site to document their portal, explain workflows for data management, and
      provide background for their enterprise. A CMS, such as WordPress, makes
      it relatively easy for non-experts to install, customize, and maintain a
      web site. By integrating with a CMS, Symbiota2 will gain many CMS
      features, such as user control over the look-and-feel, support for
      internationalization, automated update, configurable installation,
      advanced security (e.g., Wordfence), responsive layout, WYSWIG editing,
      and social media syndication.

    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Goal 6. Data Collection Enhancements</h2>
    <p>
      Users want the ability to incorporate metadata (e.g., camera EXIF data for
      images) and new kinds of data into Symbiota, such as monitoring and survey
      data. In addition, they have asked for the ability to create new data
      entry/editing forms and data cleaning tools. Symbiota2 will be designed
      for such extensibility, allowing it to easily accommodate new data types
      and improve data management. A recurring problem in data collection is
      that museums in developing countries and remote areas of North America
      have only intermittent Internet access. To help such users, Symbiota2 will
      have an offline mode. Data collected offline will be synchronized with a
      live portal when reconnected to the Internet.
