      This site provides information about the Symbiota2 NSF-ABI project.
      Symbiota2 will make it easier to modify and enhance Symbiota. What is
      Symbiota? It is open source software that has mobilized over 50 million
      specimen records from over 800 natural history collections, integrated
      their data with other resources, and shared the resulting information in
      ways that appeal to multiple user groups. Symbiota’s success stems from
      its low learning curve, powerful tools, and ability to integrate specimen
      records other resources such as images and detailed taxonomic descriptions
      and display them in ways that appeal to multiple user groups. Its success
      has resulted in many requests for additional abilities, but this is
      difficult because of the structure of its code. The Symbiota2 project
      involves restructuring of Symbiota’s code, transforming it in ways that
      will catalyze contributions, expand research use, enrich education and
      outreach activities, and increase sustainability.

    <p class="text-justify" id="proposal">
      Symbiota2’s first task was to refactor the code to increase its modularity
      in ways that would enable improving its usability and accessibility by
      adopting a plugin architecture. The current focus is on the plugins needed
      to provide Symbiota’s existing abilities, with some improvements, while
      maintain backwards compatibility. Initial improvements include giving
      network administrators the flexibility to incorporate additional
      DarwinCore fields and increasing the accuracy of data entry via minor
      modifications to the data entry page.

    <h2 class="heading-secondary text-left">The proposal</h2>
    <p class="text-left">
      The links below are to sections of the original proposal. One major change
      has been made: Symbiota2 is being written using a combination of
      Typescript and Angular. This combination will provide greater flexibility,
      speed, scalability than is possible with PHP. Their use will also make
      contributing to Symbiota2 more appealing to younger, biologically oriented
      programmers, thereby enhancing Symbiota2’s sustainability and potential.
