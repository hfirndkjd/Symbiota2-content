      The five PI’s comprise a balanced team with expertise in software
      development (Dyreson-USU, Brand [replaced by Dunn in 2020]-NAU),
      phylogenetics and spatial ecology (Pearse-USU [now Imperial College]), and
      coordinating large networks of biodiversity end users (Cobb-NAU,
      Barkworth-USU). Dyreson (Project Leader), and Brandt [now Dunn] (NAU) will
      oversee the technical portion of project, including coordination of other
      programmers. Dyreson is a computer scientist and has experience in
      software engineering and databases. Cobb (ecologist) and Barkworth
      (taxonomist) will develop training material for the transition to
      Symbiota2 and coordinate with Pearse to implement informal and formal
      training linking Symbiota with biodiversity-related research and
      education. They will also coordinate with Dyreson and Brandt/Dunn to
      implement tracking of training material usage that will allow us to assess
      the success of education materials. In addition to regular virtual
      meetings, we will have two in-person meeting in Logan in years 2 and 3 to
      assess progress and plan accordingly. We will fully support the
      transitioning from Symbiota to Symbiota2 and will work with other Symbiota
      development projects to ensure that our workflows do not conflict with
      theirs (e.g., Biotic Associations).

          tracking developments, addressing software issues, and communication
          between developers. All programming standards and practices that we

          <strong>The Symbiota Working Group</strong>
          (SWG) will continue to coordinate Symbiota users and foster
          connections with global aggregators and software-based projects. The
          SWG hosts monthly virtual meetings/webinars during the US academic
          year, which are recorded and posted on the iDigBio website. It also
          organizes outreach efforts at in-person meetings (e.g., Taxonomic
          Databases Working Group (TDWG), the Ecological Society of America, the
          Society for the Study of Evolution) and promotes increased use of
          Symbiota software. For example, Andy Miller (SWG co-Coordinator) is
          currently collaborating with GenBank and others to develop better
          genetic data linkages, and create fields to accommodate
          paleobiological data to be integrated with ePANNDA, an API for
          Enhancing Paleontological and Neontological Data Discovery

          Symbiota to Symbiota2. As part of this process, we shall update and
          extend the supporting documentation for Symbiota as well as create
          content specific to the Symbiota2 upgrade. The Symbiota2 project will
          produce a full set of tutorials in a series of training modules
          covering all aspects of digitization workflows and tools. We will
          continue to rely on power users who are “Symbiota champions” and are
          willing to create additional supporting documentation. We will provide
          dedicated support to people that must operate offline while working in
          remote locations to ensure they have efficient workflows for data
          entry and syncing data once they are connected to the Internet.

      Broader Impacts: Education/Outreach &amp; Research
    </h2>
    <p>
      The primary aim of this proposal is to develop a data-sharing
      infrastructure that will support the next generation of biodiversity
      research. Understanding the distribution and drivers of biodiversity is
      vital if we are to maintain ecosystem function and human wellbeing
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '7')">[7]</a
      ><a class="main-link">[15]</a
      ><a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '19')">[19]</a>.
      Our outreach activities will build on the training modules to increase
      understanding of biological diversity and its distribution, both spatial
      and temporal. This will enhance the intellectual underpinnings of the
      different tasks and tools in Symbiota2, suggesting how the tools can be
      used to engage with local biodiversity, and encourage exploration of the
      distribution of biodiversity in a region.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3 class="heading-tertiary-2">Integrating Data into Research</h3>
    <p>
      It is increasingly understood that biodiversity studies should not be
      limited to counts of species in a place, but must include study of
      variability in function, phylogenetic diversity, and phenology
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '53')">[53]</a>.
      Symbiota2 is being designed to provide the tools that this next generation
      of biodiversity science requires. Our phenology and phylogeny plugins will
      be implemented in collaboration with active biodiversity researchers,
      ensuring that we develop tools and methods that support and nurture this
      emerging field.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3 class="heading-tertiary-2">Research guides</h3>
    <p>
      co-PI Pearse will supervise a graduate student who will produce ‘Research
      Guides’ for selected new facets of Symbiota2 (e.g., the phenology and
      phylogeny plugins) that facilitate new research questions in biodiversity
      research. These tutorials will not just showcase how to use Symbiota2’s
      features, but also how these features can drive question-driven research.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3 class="heading-tertiary-2">Informal Biodiversity Education</h3>
    <p>
      A principal target for our outreach activities will be the thousands of
      students and volunteers who assist in data capture. Currently, there is no
      concerted effort to link their efforts to an understanding of biodiversity
      or informatics concepts. We will provide resources for developing an
      understanding of basic concepts and links to other resources that offer
      more in-depth coverage of the topics involved (e.g., Biodiversity
      Informatics Training Curriculum
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '9')">[9]</a>).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Another important target is the professionals and citizen scientists whose
      interest focuses on a specific group and/or region. We shall increase
      engagement of these individuals by creating learning modules that will
      emphasize the value of digitization, particularly as it relates to
      biodiversity data. These will complement the training modules; extending
      users ability to utilize research tools in Symbiota, including learning to
      recognize a select group of organisms, building a documented checklist,
      performing gap analysis to guide future inventories, and modeling species
      ranges and suitable habitat. All modules will include inquiry-based
      activities that reinforce concepts. There will be tutorials for using
      Symbiota2 in a scientific workflow and interacting with Symbiota2 data
      through a web service endpoint. Certification options will be built into
      the tutorials to aid individuals wishing to demonstrate their
      understanding of a topic.

      K-12 Biodiversity Portal: Co-PI Cobb has initiated planning with
      university educators and teachers associated with the NSF funded
      Lepidoptera of North America project to create a biodiversity K-12
      education portal with two versions, one targeted for high school and
      another for 6th graders. These will address Next Generation Science
      Standards
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '56')">[56]</a>
      for each respective grade level in different areas of ecology and
      conservation biology. The integration of WordPress will be extremely
      valuable in integrating existing data on Symbiota portals, which require
      some degree of taxonomic expertise, into a single framework that will
      allow us to integrate non-science terminology into specific biodiversity
      modules
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '38')">[38]</a>.
      We are developing three complementary learning modules that will use the
      Spatial Module and research tools described in this proposal to allow
      students to understand the different facets of biodiversity and how human
      activities impact it and ecosystem services.

    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Long-Term Sustainability</h2>
    <p>
      Current estimates suggest the US will not digitize all the specimens in
      its museums by 2050
      <a class="main-link" (click)="scroll('literature-cited', '18')">[18]</a>,
      and with the advances in technology we will also be adding a large amount
      of high quality images and sounds into biodiversity portals. Thus, we need
      sustainable efforts to meet this demand in the production of biodiversity
      data and ways to integrate it with data on genetics, biotic associations,
      habitat, and climate. Symbiota2 will play a significant role in meeting
      this challenge. It will be sustainable for several reasons, it is 1)
      Currently one of the most used biodiversity management systems; 2)
      Supported by several federal agencies (NSF, BLM, NPS, DOD, USDA, pending
      NEH); 3) Open source software that is optimally structured for building
      networks of museums/herbaria with minimal dedicated support resources, and
      4) Ideally suited to address the needs of the many data providers outside
      of the United States that currently do not have viable options.

          Although Symbiota is primarily used in the United States, there are
          collections set up in 13 other countries and we have made progress in
          establishing collections outside the US, including Brazil and Russia
          (Andy Miller, co-PI Cobb) Pakistan, Somaliland, China and Japan
          (Barkworth, Cobb). If collections cannot afford the small cost of
          their own portal, we have existing portals that anyone in the world
          can join

      Symbiota is funded through grants and contracts that primarily enable
      specific developments. Resources for portal management are usually covered
      as part of a curator’s responsibilities at their institution. Symbiota2
      will also rely on such funding initially but it is designed to generate
      the information needed (e.g., data size, scope, and usage at multiple
      levels from platform to collection) to create a donor pool for basic
      support of its infrastructure.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We will work through the Symbiota Working Group to develop additional
      funding streams to fund basic support for development and management. We
      will participate in TDWG and other relevant meetings to continue
      discussing revenue streams. We will also continue to obtain consensus from
      the Symbiota community to adopt a strategy to consider a suite of
      revenue-streams to cover basic support for Symbiota development and
      management.
