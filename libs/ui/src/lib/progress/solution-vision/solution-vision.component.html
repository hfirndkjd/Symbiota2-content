      Symbiota needs a fundamental restructuring in order to ensure
      maintainability and the development of new features. The transformation of
      Symbiota into Symbiota2 is completely refactoring the codebase,
      emphasizing modularity in order to improve usability and accessibility.

      Modern web development practices involve splitting a web application into
      an Application Programmer interface (API) and a User Interface (UI), in a
      practice known as the Representational State Transfer, or RESTful,
      architecture<sup><a class="main-link">4</a></sup
      >. The UI is a presentation layer, displaying data to the user. The API
      handles business logic, sending and receiving data to and from the UI when
      requested. Splitting Symbiota2 into an API and UI will improve modularity.
      New UI features will be developed independently of things like database
      access or data processing, and API logic will be independent of the
      presentation layer. Splitting the API and UI also allows for more granular
      horizontal scaling<sup><a class="main-link">5</a></sup
      >, another modern web development practice that allows for better
      performance.
    </p>

      Symbiota2 will be further modularized by utilizing a plugin architecture.
      This architecture specifies a small, extremely stable core application
      that is closed for modification, but open for extension by “plugging-in”
      new modules. This architecture will allow for user features to be toggled
      on and off, and for developers to contribute new functionality without
      having to contribute to the core Symbiota2 codebase.
    </p>
    <br />

      Many modern web development platforms come with modularization
      functionality out of the box. Angular, a frontend platform originally
      developed by Google, will be used to build the UI for Symbiota2. NestJS is
      a backend platform modeled around the same design principles as Angular
      and is a logical choice for the API. Both frameworks are written in
      Typescript, have support for building modular “libraries”, and can be
      organized within a single, full-stack monorepository utilizing a tool
      called Nx.

      Building modularity into Symbiota2 will improve the speed with which new
      features can be added and ensure maintainability and accessibility. A
      plugin architecture will allow contributors to develop content without
      having to read through inapplicable code. A single, modern web development
      language like Typescript will provide for better code quality and a lower
      barrier for entry. These improvements, taken together, will greatly
      improve the efficacy of sharing biodiversity data within the scientific
      community.
