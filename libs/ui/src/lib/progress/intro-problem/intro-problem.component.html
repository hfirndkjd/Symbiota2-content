      Biological collections in the United States have amassed over 500 million
      specimens but only 14% of these have been digitized; we need to greatly
      expand existing tools and methods to efficiently digitize specimen data.

      Symbiota1 is one of the most widely used online biodiversity data
      management software platforms. By integrating data and images from
      networks of data providers, it has helped mobilize over 37 million
      specimen records from 766 natural history collections. As a web service,
      Symbiota is one of the most successful platforms for sharing and
      displaying biodiversity data.

    <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      While Symbiota has proved to be a robust, widely-adopted platform,
      significant barriers for entry exist for developers. Lack of
      self-documenting variables, tight coupling of key modules, siloing of
      project knowledge, and lack of integrated testing could be some reasons
      that such barriers exist. These barriers for entry are evidenced by the
      fact that the two main Symbiota developers, Ed Gilbert and Ben Brandt,
      contributed 458,216 and 152,380 lines to the code base, respectively. The
      next most frequent contributor was dflemin, with 1,292 lines.2 In the
      modern open-source environment, developer accessibility and community
      contribution are key for project maintenance and avoiding software rot.
      The wide adoption of Symbiota has also yielded significant feedback on how
      it could be made more effective. Users want more features, and community
      contribution needs to be cultivated in order to develop an organizational
      infrastructure to provide those features at scale. Despite widespread
      usage in production, the code base for Symbiota is not being actively
      maintained. As a result, two independent projects have emerged as
      successors to Symbiota. The first, Symbiota Light3, began as a single-user
      fork of Symbiota and continues to be primarily supported by a single
      developer. Symbiota2 is the alternative path forward, and aims to be
      accessible to a large community of developers. There are currently four
      developers working on Symbiota2.
